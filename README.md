Avl tree
---
AVL tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where the difference betweenheights of left and right

subtrees cannot be more than one for all nodes. 
| Algorithm | Average | Worst case |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Space  | O(n)  | O(n)   |
| Search  | O(log n) | O(log n)  |
| Insert  | O(log n)  | O(log n)  |
| Delete  | O(log n)  | O(log n)  |
